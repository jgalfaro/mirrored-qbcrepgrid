## Abstract

We consider the problem of path congestion in networks of quantum repeaters and terminals. We assume networks in which the sets of complete paths between terminals may affect the capacity of repeaters in the network. We also address the problem of errors in entanglement  swapping and its mitigation using purification and error correction. We study their resource requirements, namely, their work memory complexity (e.g., number of stored qubits) and operational complexity (e.g., number of operations). We observe that concatenated error correction, versus repeated purification, requires fewer iterations and has lower operational complexity than repeated purification to reach high fidelity at the expense of increased memory requirements.
