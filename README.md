## Abstract

We consider the problem of path congestion avoidance in networks of quantum repeaters and terminals. In other words, the avoidance of situations when demands exceed capacity. We assume networks in which the sets of complete paths between terminals may affect the capacity of repeaters in the network. We compare the reduction of congestion avoidance of two representative path establishment algorithms: shortest-path establishment vs. layer-peeling path establishment. We observe that both strategies provide an equivalent entanglement rate, while the layer-peeling establishment algorithm considerably reduces the congestion in the network of repeaters. Repeaters in the inner layers get less congested and require a lower number of qubits, while providing a similar entanglement rate.
